# Chat Flippity
* All you's gotta do is enter the following to let the chatGPT enhancement begin: source chat_flippity.sh (after sourcing once, you can just hit 'scf' alias)
* For help on any commands, type `h` or `?`
* Prompts will alert you when they have been copied to the clipboard, and are therefore ready to paste into your favorite generative AI (as long as it's chat gipptiy. Just kidding!)
